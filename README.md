# osm2citygml
This tool will take XMLs of buildings from OSM using Overpass and convert it to CityGML format with OSM2World and FME for eventual use with 3DCityDB

Natively used for Ubuntu. For windows, please adjust accordingly.

Dependencies (mainly for Windows):
. Install pip (if you haven't already)
. Install Mercantile (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mercantile)
. Install VC for Python (http://aka.ms/vcpython27)
. Install pyproj

To use:

1. Install FME
2. Download OSM2World from http://osm2world.org/download/files/latest/OSM2World-latest-bin.zip, and extract.
3. Copy all files from this repository to the OSM2World-latest directory
4. Edit the first 5 lines of main.py to contain the bounding box you'd like. I strongly suggest that you change in overpass.py the Overpass URL to a local one or only do small extracts! 
5. Run "python main.py".
5. In each "tile_*" directory, you will have a file with extension .gml. You can copy these to one location and then import to 3DCityDB
